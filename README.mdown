This is a personal project to experiment with running Python on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
It includes basic tokenization and parsing of Python code and Java byte code generation.
If the Python code doesn't quite resemble PEP-8, it most likely won't parse well.

Have a look at [Jython](http://www.jython.org/) for a more useful implementation
of running Python on the JVM.
